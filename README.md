# OuterVoice - Proximity Voice Chat for Outer Wilds

OuterVoice is a **proximity-based voice chat mod** for **Outer Wilds**, allowing players to communicate with others based on their in-game distance. The further away someone is, the quieter they sound—just like real space travel (minus the whole 'no sound in space' thing)!

## Configuration
Modify settings via the `config.json` file or through the Mod Manager UI:
- `Used Mic`: Select your microphone device.
- `Voice Volume`: Adjust how loud incoming voices are.
- `Mic Volume`: Control how loud your own voice is sent to others.

## Troubleshooting
- **No mic detected?** Ensure your microphone is plugged in and selected in the config.
- **Can’t hear other players?** Check your volume settings and verify network connectivity.
- **Game crashes on startup?** Make sure all dependencies (like the multiplayer mod) are up to date.
